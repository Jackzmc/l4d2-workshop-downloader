# l4d2-workshop-downloader

A work in progress CLI tool that manages workshop items, as the current workshop implementation in L4D2 can be annoyingly slow and broken. Written as my first rust program.

Current features:

- ✔️ Import Workshop VPKs
- ⌛ **(In progress)** Update existing VPKs
- ⌛ **(In progress)** Search for items
- ❌ Manage existing items

On first setup, it will ask you for your L4D2 addons folder which you can either choose the exe's location (recommended to put it inside the addons folder), or manual path.
